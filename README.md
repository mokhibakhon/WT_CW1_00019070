This is the university website made for Web Technology Course Work 1


HTML file:

Hero Section: Big welcoming text with a cool background image, some details about the uni, and a button that takes you to the courses page.

About Section: A quick blurb about the university’s mission and why it’s awesome, plus a link to the "About" page for more details.

The file uses HTML tags like <header> and <section> to keep everything neat and organized.

There are 5 html files, and each one of them include one page.

CSS file:
Adds style and layout to the site, including responsive design and button hover effects.
It makes everything look stylish—adding colors, arranging stuff neatly, and making sure the site doesn’t fall apart on smaller screens.

Images Folder (images/): Every pretty picture you see, from the banner to the smaller visuals, is in this folder.


JS file:
It adds interactivity, like making menus open and close on click.

Mobile Menu Toggle: Clicking the hamburger menu icon opens and closes the navigation bar
If you add links to sections, the page scrolls smoothly instead of jumping around.
